# VIT-room-counselling
Objective: -
 VIT University one of  the biggest University of  India in terms of population. So hostel is one of the main aspect of this Deemed University. So for solution to that VIT had come up with room counseling procedure. In which a person can select his/her room and also roommates and obviously it is not on first come first serve bases it is based on rank of the student. So at the time of counseling rank holder have to take select the room and should have equal numbers of ID card with him. 
So whole this procedure is very hectic because some people didnâ€™t get the desired room because of their high rank and some rankers are not able to get desired numbers of roommates. So for solution to that I made a full stack web-site using nodejs, express, ejs, mongodb and many more such libraries and frameworks.
Implementation: - 
I implemented front end using HTML, CSS and java script. As backend is involved so I have used EJS as view engine. Authentication part is done using Passportjs.
So below is given the brief explanation of each and every element used in this website

HTML
Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

CSS
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.  

Java script
JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.
Node JS
Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. ... Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications.
MongoDB
MongoDB is an open source database management system (DBMS) that uses a document-oriented database model which supports various forms of data. ... Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, the MongoDB architecture is made up of collections and documents.

EJS
What is view engine?
View Engine is responsible for rendering the view into html form to the browser. By default, Asp.net MVC support Web Form(ASPX) and Razor View Engine. There are many third party view engines (like Spark, Nhaml etc.) that are also available for Asp.net MVC.
Passportjs
Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

What extra is added to given problem statement? 
I have integrated Graph of number of beds to rank (past year data) which will help students to select their room wisely with respective to their ranks. As the data is from past so this will reduce the conflicts arising due to the mismatch of plan and realty.
